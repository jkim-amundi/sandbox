#### Exploiting inefficiencies
Different types of inefficiencies could be found in the market, we can divide them into four groups:
-   Behavioural Inefficiencies
-   Analytical Inefficiencies
-   Information-Based Inefficiencies
-   Technical Inefficiencies

Focusing on the **Information-Based Inefficiencies** is important to investigate on the role of analyst in the market, especially about the downward trend regarding analyst coverage as discussed in our [research document](assets/Coverage_Extinction.pdf).
Moreover this trend is intertwined with passivisation but this is an opportunity for us:
- The desert of information for small caps is enlarging every year; scary for most asset managers, but a relative advantage for us. We can speak to companies and model the fundamentals with our own tools
- The ability of an investment firm like Amundi to support a global presence of experienced analysts and portfolio managers around the globe brings unparalleled informational advantages
- The combination of fixed income and equity analysts, as well as the contribution from the ESG research team can offer a unique holistic view of the companies we invest in
- A core tenet of these tools is to ensure that we can exploit the market inefficiencies that are set to arise from financial markets more and more dominated by passive/index following market participants
