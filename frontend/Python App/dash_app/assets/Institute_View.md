## Variables Explanation:

### Fundamental Variables:

##### Macro Momentum: 
It is based on a broad based set of indicators aiming at assessing short term momentum building in the economy. To follow the pillars considered:
-   GDP expectations revisions and Domestic and External Demand Momentum: A growing GDP indicates a healthy economy, which can strengthen the currency. Conversely, a declining GDP can lead to depreciation.
-   Fiscal Impulse Revision: fiscal impulse can help the growth but an excessive fiscal impulse can deteriorate the debt profile. High levels of debt may deter foreign investment and weaken the currency, while manageable debt levels can bolster confidence in the currency.
-   Inflation Short Term expectations and Central Banks stance expectations. Moderate inflation is normal in a growing economy, but high inflation can erode purchasing power and weaken the currency. Central banks often adjust interest rates in response to inflation.

##### External vulnerability:
-   This index is built by aggregating four different indicators (Basic balance, external debt position, reserves adequacy, and domestic conditions) that can monitor a country’s dependence on overseas economies and capital flows. High dependence is detrimental for the currency.

##### Fiscal Stance

##### Policy room 
##### ROE momentum
##### CFROI momentum
##### EPS growth

### Risk Variables
##### Geopolitical
Eurasia Group, Data Analyticsm monthly updated, we use the GPRI index, computed as the average of four indicators (Government, Society, Security and Economy), main rationale of this choice is to track the stability of a country, looking to the different factors that can affect this definition........ 
##### Political Score
##### Positioning
##### Earnings Momentum (revisions)
##### ESG score
Internal ESG Score, for each country !!!! on dashboard.xlsx there are also esg momentum how to integrate them???
### Valuation Variables
##### PE
##### Yield
##### Implied CFROI vs trend
##### EM EPS forecast models
- Coverage: earnings forecasts available for US, Europe, Global EM and, more recently, for some EM countries (Brazil, China, India, Korea, Taiwan).
- The model is an error correction model. 
This means that, on one side, we focus on relationships between relevant variables that hold in the medium term (ie. how they tend to move together); on the other side we analyze deviations from this long term relationship, or fair value, in the short term. This is when the “correction” occurs.
-   While EPS data are released quarterly, we update the models on a monthly basis to be sure to include all the recent data releases and our internal most recent scenario. This allows us to be timely in catching trend changes.
-   Variables have been  selected to capture 2 main aspects: revenues and costs. 
-   In case of the MSCI EM EPS model, variables have to fit a global area, not a single country. We include commodity price, world trade and EM exports to catch business cycle and commodity cycle. On the other side we consider CPI, rates, EMBI spread and USD Broad Trade Weighted index vs EM FX. We have internal scenario for all these variables 
-   Em countries models include both global variables and domestic variables to be able to catch the relationship with the global cycle on one side and the domestic situation on the other.
-   Thanks to the ECM and the internal scenarios on the explanatory variables, we can build forward looking forecast on 12 months horizon. 

##### Macro fair value
###### Fair Value Models:
-   Macro scenario applied to asset class valuations - to assess the macro target price for different asset classes.  For the equity assessment we use a mix of macro fundamental variables (mainly inflation and growth at country level) and micro fundamental variables (earnings, 10y bond yields, commodity prices).
